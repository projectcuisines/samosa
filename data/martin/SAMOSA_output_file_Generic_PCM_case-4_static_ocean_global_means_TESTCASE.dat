# Columns of data
#
# INPUTS:
# Sample = Sample number (1-64, see Table 1 and Table 4 in the protocol)
# Inst = instellation (W/m^2, defined by the sample number)

# Fnet = global, annual mean net longwave radiative flux (W/m^2)
# Ocnfrac = global, annual mean open ocean fraction (i.e., fraction not covered by sea ice)
# Icethick = global, annual mean ice thickness (km)
# Qstrat = global, annual mean stratospheric specific humidity (kg/kg, at 1 hPa or model top, whichever is lower)
# Qmass = global, annual mean vertically integrated water vapor column mass (kg/m^2)
# Cldliq = global, annual mean cloud verticially integrated liquid column mass (kg/m^2)
